## Applied Mechanism
![alt text](https://github.com/HendSoliman/e-commerce-checkout/blob/main/Checkout.PNG?raw=true)
## Done

- [x] Spring Boot Application implement a multilayered architecture - Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- [x] RESTful Web Service (CRUD)
- [x] Apply Design pattern (Builder, Factory , )
- [x] Logger (Console, File)

## To-Do
- [ ] Asynchronous API Design - To User reactive streams
- [ ] Integrate with a credit card payment tool to deduct the money from the customer credit card. service layer is ready and to integrate with *https://stripe.com/ 
- [ ] Unit testing for each layer & integration testing for each endpoint.
- [ ] Logger in each layer 


## Running the application locally [Backend]

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in theclass from your IDE.
## For The First Time Run

```shell
then spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```
```shell
spring.datasource.initialization-mode=never
```

- Unzip the zip file (if you downloaded one)
- Open Command Prompt and Change directory (cd) to folder containing pom.xml
- Open Eclipse 
   - File -> Import -> Existing Maven Project -> Navigate to the folder where you unzipped the zip
   - Select the project
- Choose the Spring Boot Application file (search for @SpringBootApplication)
- Right Click on the file and Run as Java Application
- go through http://localhost:8080/h2-console  to access DB 

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```
```shell
npm run serve
```

## Documentation
*  [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) - Documentation & Testing    with common-documents api folder
*  [sonarlint](https://www.sonarlint.org/)detect and fix quality issues as you write code.
